## [2026-03-25] Purge YAGNI scaffolding from rostrum artists
**Prompt:** Follow setup-artist skill and remove all unneeded scaffolding files/folders from rostrum artist directories (except gatsby-grace)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- rostrum/artists: Deleted scaffolding from 43 artist directories — removed `.env.example`, `README.md`, `apps/`, `config/`, `content/`, `memory/`, placeholder `context/` files (template artist.md, audience.md, era.json, tasks.md, images/README.md), `releases/README.md`, `songs/README.md`, and empty directories
- rostrum/artists: Cleaned RECOUP.md body text for all 43 artists (kept frontmatter only, matching gatsby-grace format)
- 38 artists now have only `RECOUP.md`; 5 artists retain real content alongside RECOUP.md (fat-beats: social-reports + weekly dashboard; gliiico: spotify tracking CSV; julius-black: tiktok tracking + snapshot; mac-miller: weekly news; spaceheater: competitor analysis report)
- gatsby-grace left untouched (already follows the new skill structure)
**PRs:** none — changes are local in `.local/records/rostrum/`
**Notes:** Per the setup-artist skill: "Nothing gets created until there's real content to put in it." All deleted files were empty scaffolding or placeholder templates with `{curly brace tokens}`. Real content files (tracking CSVs, reports, analysis) were preserved. When an artist gets real context, create `context/artist.md` and other files per the setup-artist skill.

## [2026-03-25] Song filtering for content creation pipeline
**Prompt:** Add optional `songs` array to content creation payload so the pipeline can restrict which songs it picks from
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- tasks: Added `songs` field to `createContentPayloadSchema`, filtering logic in `selectAudioClip`, pass-through in `createContentTask`
- api: Added `songs` to Zod validation (`validateCreateContentBody`), handler (`createContentHandler`), and trigger interface (`triggerCreateContent`)
- docs: Added `songs` property to `ContentCreateRequest` schema in `openapi.json`
- cli: Added `--songs <slugs>` comma-separated flag to `recoup content create` command
**PRs:**
- https://github.com/recoupable/tasks/pull/112 (base: main)
- https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/348 (base: test)
- https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/80 (base: main)
- https://github.com/recoupable/cli/pull/19 (base: main)
**Notes:** Backward compatible — when `songs` is omitted, all songs remain eligible. Song slugs match filenames without extension (e.g. `hiccups` for `hiccups.mp3`). The caller (chat agent, Slack bot, CLI) is responsible for resolving user intent into song slugs. All existing tests pass (183 tasks, 1553 api).

## [2026-03-25] YAGNI setup-artist skill + consolidate Gatsby Grace
**Prompt:** Simplify the setup-artist skill and consolidate three gatsby-grace directories into one
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- skills/setup-artist: Rewrote SKILL.md (178→120 lines, 9→5 steps, 10→2 directories). Deleted all 6 reference files (memory-system.md, services-guide.md, env-template.md, directory-readmes.md, root-readme.md, context-files.md). Skill now only creates `context/` and `songs/` — other directories created by other skills when needed.
- rostrum/gatsby-grace: Consolidated data from 3 directories. Merged filled `artist.md` (from local) + `brand.md` content. Replaced placeholder `audience.md` with filled version (from old). Copied 17 songs with proper `{slug}.mp3` naming + wav + lyrics.json + clips.json. Renamed `library/` → `research/`. Dropped stale `reports/`. Deleted all scaffolding (memory/, config/, content/, apps/, era.json, tasks.md, .env.example, 8 READMEs). Updated RECOUP.md with minimal "What's Here" + "Adding Things" guidance.
**PRs:** none yet — changes are local, need to commit and push to rostrum repo and skills repo
**Notes:** The tasks content pipeline only reads `context/artist.md`, `context/audience.md`, `context/images/face-guide.png`, and `songs/*.mp3` via GitHub API. No per-artist config needed — pipeline uses hardcoded defaults. Song naming matters: pipeline derives title from filename, so `{slug}.mp3` not `audio.mp3`. Old gatsby-grace directories (`.local/records/artists/gatsby-grace` and `gatsby-grace-old`) can be deleted after verifying pipeline works. Other rostrum artists still have the old bloated scaffolding — migrate separately.

## [2026-03-25] Round 5 lint + KISS fixes for PR #342 (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Fix the failing checks on PR #342
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: Deleted `lib/coding-agent/getThread.ts` wrapper (KISS nit from code reviewer) — callers now import `getThread` directly from `lib/agents/getThread` with type parameter
- api: Fixed unused `message` parameter lint error in `registerOnNewMention.ts`
- api: Updated test mocks to match new import paths
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/342 (commit `694f201`)
**Notes:** All CI checks (test, format, CodeRabbit, Vercel) were already passing. These fixes address the last code review nit and lint cleanliness. 6 files changed, 9 ins, 19 del.

---

## [2026-03-25] Round 2 review fixes for PR #342 (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Address new board + CodeRabbit feedback on content-agent PR #342
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: SRP — split `validateEnv.ts` into `isContentAgentConfigured.ts` + `validateContentAgentEnv.ts`
- api: KISS — refactored `bot.ts` to eager singleton variable matching coding-agent pattern
- api: KISS — refactored `registerHandlers.ts` to module-level side-effect registration (removed flag)
- api: DRY — extracted shared `getThread` to `lib/agents/getThread.ts` (both agents use it)
- api: CodeRabbit — added Zod platform validation + JSON error responses in `createPlatformRoutes.ts`
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/342 (commit `2abed88`)
**Notes:** 10 files changed, 60 ins / 65 del. Bot init DRY question addressed: both agents already share `createAgentState` + `agentLogger`; remaining adapter config differs per agent so further abstraction would violate KISS. Awaiting Code Reviewer re-review.

---

## [2026-03-25] TDD mandate for SR Dev — API & Tasks (REC-11)
**Prompt:** Update SR Dev AGENTS.md to mandate TDD red-green-refactor for API and Tasks codebases
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- agents/sr-dev/AGENTS.md: Added "Test-Driven Development (API & Tasks)" section mandating strict red-green-refactor cycle for all work in api and tasks codebases
**PRs:** none (local instruction change)
**Notes:** SR Dev must now write failing tests before any production code in api or tasks. Includes rules for bug fixes (reproduce first) and commit-per-phase guidance.

---

## [2026-03-25] CLEAN code review fixes for PR #342 (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Address 7 board feedback items on PR #342 (YAGNI, SRP, DRY, KISS, restructure)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: Removed unused `/api/launch` endpoint and `lib/launch/` (YAGNI)
- api: Extracted `parseMentionArgs` to own file, renamed handler → `registerOnNewMention.ts` (SRP)
- api: Created shared `lib/agents/createPlatformRoutes.ts` factory used by both coding-agent and content-agent (DRY)
- api: Created shared `lib/agents/createAgentState.ts` for Redis/ioredis state (DRY)
- api: Moved callback auth into handler to match coding-agent pattern (KISS)
- api: Restructured `lib/content-agent/` → `lib/agents/content/`
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/342
**Notes:** 21 files changed, 206 ins, 511 del. Awaiting Code Reviewer re-review.

---

## [2026-03-25] QA Test PR #342 — content-agent & launch endpoints (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Test the changes in PR #342 against Vercel deployment preview
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- none (testing only)
**PRs:** none
**Notes:** Initial test run (11 cases) found 5 failures — content-agent endpoints returned 500 due to missing env vars crashing `getContentAgentBot()`. Sr Dev fixed with `isContentAgentConfigured()` guard and moved auth before bot init (commit `9da3aef`). Re-test: all 11 cases pass. Results posted on GitHub PR #342 and Slack #code-review thread. Task marked done.

---

## [2026-03-25] Hire QA Tester agent (REC-10)
**Prompt:** Create a QA Tester agent that tests API PRs by running fetch requests against Vercel deployment previews
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- mono: Created `agents/qa-tester/AGENTS.md` — full instructions for deployment preview testing, endpoint discovery from PR diffs, structured test reporting
- mono: Updated `agents/code-reviewer/AGENTS.md` — added QA Tester Integration section (trigger QA Tester after approving API PRs)
- mono: Updated `agents/sr-dev/AGENTS.md` — added QA Tester Feedback section (handle test failure reports)
- Paperclip: Submitted hire request for QA Tester agent (f4d6bc75-b9ea-4fca-a456-4b889548ad83, claude-sonnet-4-6, reports to CTO)
**PRs:** none (local instruction changes)
**Notes:** Approval granted (d2fcb05e). Agent ID: f4d6bc75-b9ea-4fca-a456-4b889548ad83, urlKey: qa-tester. Agent workflow: Code Reviewer approves API PR → @-mentions QA Tester → QA Tester runs fetch tests against Vercel preview → reports on GitHub PR + Slack → routes failures to Sr Dev.

## [2026-03-24] API — review PR #342 (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Review clean PR #342 (superseding #341) for content-agent feature, identify Vercel build failure cause
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- none (review only)
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/342 (approved after 1 review cycle)
**Notes:** Initial review found 2 blocking issues: (1) module-level env validation crashed Vercel build, (2) fragile thread ID parsing. Sr Dev fixed both (commit `5ca4293`). Re-review confirmed fixes + all CI checks pass (test, format, Vercel). PR approved and ready to merge. Slack thread updated.

---

## [2026-03-24] Connect Code Reviewer and Sr Dev review loop (REC-9)
**Prompt:** Set up automated review loop between Sr Dev and Code Reviewer agents
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- agents/code-reviewer/AGENTS.md: Added "Review Loop with Sr Dev" section — when @-mentioned by Sr Dev, review the PR; if changes needed, @-mention Sr Dev back; if approved, @-mention Sr Dev and close
- agents/sr-dev/AGENTS.md: Added "Review Loop with Code Reviewer" section — after creating/updating a PR, @-mention Code Reviewer; when feedback arrives, fix and @-mention again; loop until approved
**PRs:** none (local instruction changes)
**Notes:** Both agents now have symmetric handoff instructions. The loop uses Paperclip @-mentions to trigger heartbeats. Sr Dev starts the cycle by @-mentioning Code Reviewer after pushing a PR. Code Reviewer closes the cycle by @-mentioning Sr Dev with approval/feedback.

---

## [2026-03-24] API — fix PR #341 review feedback (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Fix code review feedback on content-agent PR #341
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: Created clean branch `fix/content-agent-clean` from `test` with only 17 new feature files (removed ~90 JSDoc-only changes)
- api: Renamed `handlers/handleContentAgentCallback.ts` → `registerOnSubscribedMessage.ts` (naming collision fix)
- api: Added `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for callback secret comparison in `handleContentAgentCallback.ts`
- api: Fixed all JSDoc lint errors in new feature files
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/342 (supersedes #341)
**Notes:** Old PR #341 had 106 files changed (90 unrelated JSDoc noise). New PR #342 has only 17 files. Posted update to Slack thread and commented on #341. Task reassigned to board for review.

---

## [2026-03-24] API — review PR #341 (REC-7)
**Prompt:** Review PR https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/341 and provide feedback
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- none (review only)
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/341 (reviewed, request changes)
**Notes:** PR adds Recoup Content Agent Slack bot + `/api/launch` endpoint. Verdict: request changes. Blocking issue: ~90 unrelated JSDoc-only changes inflate PR from ~16 new feature files to 106. Feature code itself is clean. Also flagged naming collision between two `handleContentAgentCallback` files and suggested `crypto.timingSafeEqual` for callback secret. Review comment: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/341#issuecomment-4121681007

---

## [2026-03-24] Docs — fix PR #78 feedback (REC-6)
**Prompt:** Fix feedback comments on docs PR #78 and update Slack thread
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- docs: Linked `POST /api/content-agent/callback` to its API reference page in data flow and endpoints table
- docs: Added missing `RECOUP_API_KEY` to environment variables table
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/78 (updated, commit `2149b60`)
**Notes:** Posted summary to #code-review Slack thread. PR still open for review.

---

## [2026-03-24] Code Reviewer agent created (REC-4)
**Prompt:** Create a new agent to review unmerged PRs in Recoup mono repo submodules
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- Paperclip: Created "Code Reviewer" agent (QA role, claude-sonnet-4-6, reports to CTO)
- Agent ID: 8dec924a-7c20-4280-985d-f3ea996e0c4e (urlKey: code-reviewer-2)
- Approval: d2fbd753 (approved after revision to add CLEAN code principles)
- mono: Created `agents/code-reviewer/AGENTS.md` with review instructions (SRP, OCP, DRY, YAGNI, security checklist)
- Set instructions path via API
**PRs:** none (instructions file created locally, not yet committed)
**Notes:** Agent is idle and ready for tasks. First revision was requested by board to emphasize CLEAN coding principles — incorporated into capabilities and instructions. Old agent 815e3d4f (Code Reviewer 1) was from the rejected first hire attempt.

---

## [2026-03-24] Recoup Content Agent scaffold
**Prompt:** Scaffold the content-agent Slack bot following the coding-agent pattern
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: Added `content-agent` Slack bot (routes, handlers, bot singleton, callback) on `feature/content-agent` branch
- tasks: Added `poll-content-run` Trigger.dev task on `feature/content-agent` branch
**PRs:** Branches pushed — PRs need to be created manually (api → test, tasks → main)
**Notes:** New env vars needed: `SLACK_CONTENT_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CONTENT_SIGNING_SECRET`, `CONTENT_AGENT_CALLBACK_SECRET`. Also needs `RECOUP_API_BASE_URL` in tasks env. Slack App must be created with `app_mentions:read` + `chat:write` scopes.

## Current State of Each Submodule

### `tasks` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `fad189e` fix: push mono repo root progress files directly to main (#96)
- `e2599e7` fix: set cwd to `/vercel/sandbox/mono` for Claude Code agent (#94)
- `70f345c` feat: increase maxDuration of coding-agent task (#89)
- `6625395` feat: inject `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` into sandbox environment (#86)

**Status:** Stable. The coding agent pipeline is working end-to-end:
1. Sandbox spins up → monorepo cloned → submodules synced
2. Claude Code agent runs with the user prompt (cwd = `/vercel/sandbox/mono`)
3. Changes are committed and PRs opened via `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent`
4. Mono repo root files (e.g., `PROGRESS.md`) are pushed directly to `main`

**What to know:** `runClaudeCodeAgent` now defaults `cwd` to `/vercel/sandbox/mono`. The `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent` agent handles both mono root changes (direct push to main) and submodule changes (feature branch + PR).

---

### `api` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `6ff735d` feat: add Slack chat bot integration for Record Label Agent (#296)
- `f1d9035` feat: add content-creation API endpoints and video persistence (#259)
- `5b1f6bc` feat: admin accounts table endpoint (#288)
- `6c5eda3` feat: endpoint to check if authenticated account is admin (#281)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch, not `main`.

**What to know:** Slack integration added for Record Label Agent. Content-creation endpoints live. Admin-check endpoint added.

---

### `chat` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `03714296` feat: add navbar item for accounts (#1574)
- `729a9062` feat: task page top-left back link (#1573)
- `6efe316d` fix: duration stuck at 0ms for in-progress tasks (#1572)
- `eaeb5799` feat: polling UI for `prompt_sandbox` when `runId` present (#1563)
- `c3611b31` feat: move pulse to tasks page as Schedule/Recent/Pulse tabs (#1561)
- `c7fb2744` feat: artist connectors UI with tabbed settings modal (#1558)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch.

**What to know:** Tasks page has been significantly built out — duration display, polling UI for sandbox runs, and pulse moved to tabs. Navbar now has accounts link.

---

### `cli` (on `main`, v0.1.11)
**Latest commits:**
- `a09929a` chore: bump version to 0.1.11
- `e4d4548` feat: add `recoup content` command suite (#13)
- `07e2b85` feat: add `music analyze` command (#7)
- `056257a` feat: add `--account` flag to notifications command (#12)

**Status:** Stable. Published to npm as `0.1.11`.

**What to know:** `recoup content` command suite added. `music analyze` command added. Version auto-bumped via CI.

---

### `docs` (on `main`, feature branch `feat/mcp-docs-full-tool-list` open)
**Latest commits:**
- `05c455c` docs: improve user journey — navigation, quickstart, MCP client configs
- `e083670` docs: expand MCP page with full tool list and docs search MCP explanation
- `fd82b14` feat: add authentication page (#62)

**Status:** Feature branch `feat/mcp-docs-full-tool-list` pushed, PR needs to be opened against `main`.

**What changed (2026-03-24 user journey improvements):**
- Navigation order fixed: Authentication now comes before MCP in sidebar
- Homepage (`index.mdx`): integration path cards (REST/MCP/CLI), clearer "what you can build" framing
- Quickstart (`quickstart.mdx`): new first example uses Spotify search (works immediately, no existing data needed); Tasks list removed as first example
- MCP page (`mcp.mdx`): ready-to-paste config snippets for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code added before TypeScript SDK
- API reference intro (`api-reference/introduction.mdx`): stripped duplicate auth/base URL content, now links to auth guide

---

### `admin` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `3fcd006` feat: update favicon to match app (#6)
- `11b64e2` feat: accounts table with subscription status (#5)
- `5dd9571` feat: endpoint to check if account is admin (#3)
- `47295e8` feat: Privy login support (#2)
- `b53363f` feat: initial Next.js app setup (#1)

**Status:** Stable. Basic admin dashboard with Privy auth, accounts table, admin check, and new Org Repos commits table.

**What to know:** Added `/sandboxes/orgs` page showing a data table of commits per org sub-module. Key column is "Recent Commits" (latest_commit_messages array) showing up to 5 latest commit messages per repo. Data from `GET /api/admins/sandboxes/orgs`. New files: `types/sandbox.ts` (OrgRepoRow), `lib/fetchAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `hooks/useAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `components/SandboxOrgs/*`, `app/sandboxes/orgs/page.tsx`, `components/Home/OrgReposNavButton.tsx`. Nav button added to AdminDashboard.

## [2026-03-25] marketing: Clarify deployment domain and two-app structure in AGENTS.md

**Prompt:** Apply code review feedback on branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-update-or-codebas-1774058502626` — answer Sweets' questions: what domain does marketing deploy to, and why are there multiple apps?
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `marketing`: Updated `AGENTS.md` — Deployment section now explicitly states public site deploys to `https://recoupable.com`. Added new "Why Two Apps?" section explaining `apps/web` (public site, SEO, blog) vs `apps/ops` (internal marketing ops tooling, private workflows). Pushed to existing branch.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-update-or-codebas-1774058502626` pushed to `recoupable/marketing` — PR targets `main`
**Notes:** The marketing repo was already on this feature branch. AGENTS.md is symlinked as CLAUDE.md — both updated together automatically.

---

## [2026-03-24] chat: implement PR review feedback — streamdown plugins

**Prompt:** Implement PR review comments on https://github.com/recoupable/chat/pull/1592 (streamdown v1→v2 upgrade)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `chat`: Installed `@streamdown/code@1.1.1`, `@streamdown/math@1.0.2`, `@streamdown/mermaid@1.0.2`.
- `chat`: Updated `components/ai-elements/response.tsx` to import and pass `plugins={{ code, math, mermaid }}` to `<Streamdown>`. `defaultPlugins` defined as module-level constant for stable reference.
- `chat`: Added `@source` directives in `app/globals.css` for the three new plugin packages so Tailwind scans their classes.
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/chat/pull/1592 (branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-update-chat-to-th-1774075858898`)
**Notes:**
- P1 bot review resolved: streamdown v2 moved code highlighting, math, and mermaid behind optional plugins — without them, code blocks had no syntax highlighting and mermaid/math wouldn't render.
- `katex/dist/katex.min.css` was already imported in `globals.css` — math CSS was pre-existing.

---

## [2026-03-24] Code Review — chat: streamdown v1→v2 upgrade

**Prompt:** Code review for branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-update-chat-to-th-1774075858898` (streamdown v1.1.6 → v2.5.0)
**Status:** completed — no fixes needed, changes are correct
**Changes:**
- `chat`: Reviewed 3-file diff: `package.json` (version bump), `app/globals.css` (`@source` glob), `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-update-chat-to-th-1774075858898` — PR needs to be opened targeting `test`.
**Notes:**
- `@source dist/*.js` glob is the official v2 recommendation (v2 splits classes across 4 files vs 1 in v1).
- `Streamdown` component API is backward compatible — `className`, `children`, `components`, `rehypePlugins`, `remarkPlugins` all still present.
- `data-streamdown='code-block'` CSS selectors in `response.tsx` still valid in v2 (confirmed in `chunk-BO2N2NFS.js`).
- v2 ships `streamdown/styles.css` with animation keyframes — not imported, not needed unless `animated` prop is used.

## [2026-03-20] Fix Chartmetric Proxy Route TypeScript Build Error

**Prompt:** Verify the build works on feature/chartmetric-proxy branch
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: Fixed `app/api/chartmetric/[...path]/route.ts` — params must be `Promise<{path: string[]}>` and awaited in Next.js 15+. The type error `.next/types/validator.ts TS2344` is now resolved. TypeScript compiles successfully (`✓ Compiled successfully`). All 5 Chartmetric tests pass.
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/318 (feature/chartmetric-proxy → test, existing PR updated)
**Notes:** Build still fails at "collect page data" step due to missing SUPABASE_URL/SUPABASE_KEY env vars in sandbox — pre-existing environment issue, not from our changes. TypeScript itself is clean for the new code.

---

## [2026-03-16] Account Task Runs Page + Pulse Sub-Task Tagging

**Prompt:** Admin page to view recent Pulse task runs for a specific account (e.g., "What Pulse emails has Alexis received in the past 7 days?")
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: Created `sendPulseTask` sub-task (`src/tasks/sendPulseTask.ts`). `sendPulsesTask` now calls `sendPulseTask.triggerAndWait(..., { tags: ['account:<id>'] })` per account so each run is queryable by account.
- `api`: Updated `validateGetTaskRunQuery.ts` to accept optional `account_id` query param. Admins (Bearer) can query any account; org API keys can query org members. New supabase fn `selectAllAccountSnapshotsWithOwners` returns `{account_id, github_repo}[]`. `buildSubmoduleRepoMap` now returns `AccountRepoEntry[]` with account_id. `getOrgRepoStats` + `getAdminSandboxOrgsHandler` enriched to include email in `account_repos`.
- `docs`: `openapi.json` — added `account_id` param to `GET /api/tasks/runs`, updated `OrgRepoRow.account_repos` schema to `{account_id, email, repo_url}[]`.
- `admin`: New `/accounts/[account_id]` page with `AccountDetailPage` + `TaskRunsTable` showing Pulse runs. `AccountReposList` updated — each entry shows clickable email → `/accounts/[id]`. `sandboxesColumns` — account email is now a clickable link to `/accounts/[id]`.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually (gh not available in sandbox):
- tasks: `feature/pulse-sub-task-account-tag`
- api: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param` (target: `test`)
- docs: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param`
- admin: `feature/account-task-runs-page`
**Notes:** To answer "What Pulse emails has Alexis received?": find Alexis's `account_id` via `/sandboxes` page (or `/sandboxes/orgs`), then go to `/accounts/<id>` — the page shows all `send-pulse-task` runs for that account with status and timestamps.

---

## [2026-03-16] Pulse Run onClick — Email HTML Preview

**Prompt:** On /accounts/[account_id], clicking a send-pulse-task row should show the Resend email HTML sent during that task run.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New `lib/supabase/memory_emails/selectAccountEmailIds.ts` — joins rooms → memories → memory_emails to get Resend email IDs for an account. New `lib/admins/emails/getAdminEmailsHandler.ts` + `app/api/admins/emails/route.ts` — `GET /api/admins/emails?account_id=<id>` fetches each email from Resend SDK (returns id, subject, to, from, html, created_at). Admin Bearer auth required.
- `admin`: `TaskRunsTable` — added optional `onRunClick` prop; rows show `cursor-pointer` when clickable. `AccountDetailPage` — tracks `selectedRun` state, passes `onRunClick` to pulse runs table. New `PulseEmailModal` — fetches all emails for the account via `usePulseEmails`, matches the email closest to the run's time window (±5 min buffer), renders HTML in a sandboxed iframe. New `usePulseEmails` hook (lazy, enabled only when modal opens). New `fetchAccountPulseEmails` lib function.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually:
- api: `feature/admin-pulse-email-preview` (target: `test`)
- admin: `feature/pulse-email-preview` (target: `main`)
**Notes:** Email matching uses the run's `startedAt`/`finishedAt` window ±5 min. Falls back to the most recent email for the account if no match. The `memory_emails` table is the link — emails only appear here if `handleSendEmailToolOutputs` was called after the pulse (i.e., the sandbox chat flow ran through the standard chat handler). If pulse emails aren't showing, check that `memory_emails` rows are being inserted for pulse runs.

## [2026-03-17] Admin README — API Calls Documentation

**Prompt:** Update the Admin README to highlight the API calls used and link to the docs where devs can learn more.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `admin`: Rewrote `README.md` — added "API Calls" section with a table of all 5 endpoints (`/api/admins`, `/api/admins/emails`, `/api/admins/sandboxes`, `/api/admins/sandboxes/orgs`, `/api/tasks/runs`), doc links to `developers.recoupable.com`, and a "Where each call is made" breakdown per hook/lib file. Also updated Tech Stack section to include Privy and TanStack React Query.
**PRs:** none (README-only change)
**Notes:** Doc links point to `https://developers.recoupable.com/api-reference/admins/*` and `.../tasks/runs`. All admin endpoints require Bearer auth (Privy access token).

## [2026-03-17] Admin Privy Logins Page

**Prompt:** Admin dashboard page to review Privy logins on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis — total count + table of results per time frame.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Added `GET /api/admins/privy` to `openapi.json` (path + `PrivyLoginRow` / `AdminPrivyLoginsResponse` schemas), new `api-reference/admins/privy.mdx`, updated `docs.json` nav.
- `api`: New `lib/admins/privy/fetchPrivyLogins.ts` — paginates Privy Management API, stops early once users are older than the cutoff. New `validateGetPrivyLoginsQuery.ts` (period: daily/weekly/monthly, default daily). New `getPrivyLoginsHandler.ts`. New `app/api/admins/privy/route.ts`. 11 unit tests, all green.
- `admin`: New `types/privy.ts`, `lib/recoup/fetchPrivyLogins.ts`, `hooks/usePrivyLogins.ts`. New `/privy` page with period toggle (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), total count badge, and login table (email, Privy DID, timestamp). Added "View Privy Logins" nav button to `AdminDashboard`.
**PRs:** Branches pushed — PRs need to be opened via GitHub:
- docs: `feature/admin-privy-logins-docs` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/new/feature/admin-privy-logins-docs
- api: `feature/admin-privy-logins` → test: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/feature/admin-privy-logins
- admin: `feature/privy-logins-page` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/admin/pull/new/feature/privy-logins-page
**Notes:** `fetchPrivyLogins` paginates `GET https://api.privy.io/v1/users?order=desc` and stops early once `created_at < cutoff`. This keeps the daily call fast (only fetches recent pages). If Privy returns users without `linked_accounts` email, the row shows `null` for email.

## [2026-03-17] API — Remove Org API Key Logic (All Keys Are Personal)

**Prompt:** All API keys are personal. If a personal account has access to an org, it can use account_id filtering within that org. Remove the distinction between personal and org API keys for access control.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New `lib/organizations/canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg.ts` — checks if two accounts share any org membership (2 DB queries: get current account's orgs, then check if target is in any of them). New `lib/organizations/__tests__/canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg.test.ts` (4 tests). Updated `lib/auth/validateAccountIdOverride.ts` — when `orgId` is null (personal key) and target ≠ self, falls back to `canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg()` instead of immediately returning 403. Updated `lib/auth/__tests__/validateAuthContext.test.ts` — updated "denies personal key" test to mock the new function, added "allows personal key with shared org" test. All 1526 tests pass.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/remove-org-api-key-logic` pushed to `recoupable/api` (target: `test`):
- https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/agent/remove-org-api-key-logic
**Notes:** Only `validateAccountIdOverride.ts` was changed in auth. The `buildGet*Params` functions that receive `orgId` from auth context don't need changes — when a personal key accesses via shared org, `orgId` in the auth context stays `null`, and the query params builders already handle `orgId: null` by not filtering on org. The access gate is purely in `validateAccountIdOverride`.

## [2026-03-24] Docs — MCP Page Rewrite (Full Tool List + Docs Search MCP)

**Prompt:** Document both MCP servers in docs: (1) the Mintlify docs search MCP and (2) the Recoup API MCP with a full list of all tools.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Rewrote `mcp.mdx` — now explains both servers (Mintlify docs search MCP via contextual menu, and the Recoup API MCP at `https://recoup-api.vercel.app/mcp`). Documents all 44 tools grouped by category (Artists, Chats, Tasks, Pulses, Catalogs, Spotify, YouTube, Search, Images, Video, Audio, Files, Communication, Segments, Sandboxes, Utilities). Removed outdated `run_sandbox_command` entry (tool doesn't exist). Added connection snippet and two call examples.
**PRs:** Branch `feat/mcp-docs-full-tool-list` pushed — open PR via: https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/new/feat/mcp-docs-full-tool-list
**Notes:** Tool list was derived from all `register*Tool.ts` files in `api/lib/mcp/tools/`. The `run_sandbox_command` in the old mcp.mdx was stale — no such tool is registered. If new tools are added to the API, update this page.

## [2026-03-26] Song Filtering for Content Creation Pipeline

**Prompt:** Add optional `songs` array to content creation payload so callers can restrict clip selection to specific songs (e.g., for an EP, a single, or a named album track).
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: `src/schemas/contentCreationSchema.ts` — added `songs: z.array(z.string()).optional()`. `src/content/selectAudioClip.ts` — filters `songPaths` by slug before random pick; throws clear error if none found. `src/tasks/createContentTask.ts` — passes `payload.songs` to `selectAudioClip`. New `src/content/__tests__/selectAudioClip.test.ts` — 4 tests covering filter-to-one, filter-to-many, missing-song error, and no-filter (all-songs) cases. `src/schemas/__tests__/contentCreationSchema.test.ts` — 2 new tests for songs field.
- `api`: `lib/trigger/triggerCreateContent.ts` — added `songs?: string[]` to `TriggerCreateContentPayload`.
**PRs:** `gh` not available in sandbox — PRs need to be opened via GitHub:
- tasks: `feature/song-filtering-for-content-pipeline` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/tasks/pull/new/feature/song-filtering-for-content-pipeline
- api: changes committed to `test` branch directly (was already on test with many staged changes)
**Notes:** Filtering is path-based: `path.includes('/songs/${slug}/')`. Callers (Slack bot, chat agent) are responsible for translating user intent (e.g., "ADHD EP") into song slugs before passing to the task. When `songs` is omitted, all songs remain eligible (backward-compatible).

## Known Issues / Next Steps

- `SUBMODULE_CONFIG` in `tasks/src/sandboxes/submoduleConfig.ts` does **not** include `admin` or `marketing` — if the agent modifies those submodules, PRs won't be auto-created. Consider adding them.
- No `PROGRESS_USAGE.md` exists yet — if this file should have a companion usage guide, create it.
- The `progress.txt` init file referenced in the task prompt was not found — likely hasn't been created yet, or was intended as a seed for future use.

## Architecture Reminder

```
chat (frontend) → api (backend) → Supabase (database)
                              ↘ tasks (async Trigger.dev jobs)
```

- **Coding agent flow:** Trigger.dev task → Vercel Sandbox → Claude Code CLI (`claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`) → git commit/push → PR via `gh`
- PRs for `api` and `chat` target `test` branch; all others target `main`
- Admin check: POST `/api/admins/check` — verifies if authenticated Privy user is in admins table

## [2026-03-17] Docs — Added response items for GET /api/admins/privy

**Prompt:** Update docs for GET /api/admins/privy to include the latest API response — missing default of `all` for period and missing response fields (`total_new`, `total_active`, `total_privy_users`)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Updated `api-reference/openapi.json` — added `all` to `period` enum (set as default, replacing incorrect `daily` default); added missing 200 response fields: `total_new`, `total_active`, `total_privy_users`; updated endpoint description to reflect actual API behavior.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-docs---added-resp-1773769254740` pushed to `recoupable/docs` — PR targeting `main`.
**Notes:** Actual API code (`validateGetPrivyLoginsQuery.ts`) defaults `period` to `"all"` (no date filter). Handler returns `{ status, total, total_new, total_active, total_privy_accounts, logins }`.

---

## [2026-03-17] Docs — Rename total_privy_users to total_privy_accounts

**Prompt:** Change `total_privy_users` to `total_privy_accounts` in the GET /api/admins/privy OpenAPI spec.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Renamed `total_privy_users` → `total_privy_accounts` in `api-reference/openapi.json` (required field list, property name, and description).
**PRs:** Pushed to existing branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-docs---added-resp-1773769254740` on `recoupable/docs`.
**Notes:** Matches the API response field naming convention (accounts, not users).

## [2026-03-24] Docs User Journey Improvements

**Prompt:** Review docs from a user journey perspective — are they clear for Humans and Agents?
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Navigation order fixed — authentication before MCP in sidebar
- `docs`: Homepage (`index.mdx`) — integration path cards (REST API / MCP / CLI), clearer "what you can build" framing for humans and agents
- `docs`: Quickstart (`quickstart.mdx`) — first example now uses Spotify search (no existing data needed, works immediately); removed Tasks list as first example; added MCP in next steps
- `docs`: MCP page (`mcp.mdx`) — added copy-paste config snippets for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and VS Code before the TypeScript SDK; moved tool reference after connection guides
- `docs`: API reference intro (`api-reference/introduction.mdx`) — removed duplicate auth/base URL content; now a clean page linking to auth guide
**PRs:** Branch `feat/mcp-docs-full-tool-list` pushed to `recoupable/docs`. PR needs to be opened against `main`.
**Notes:** `gh` CLI not available in this sandbox — PR must be created manually or via the next agent run that has GitHub access.

## [2026-03-24] Composio connectors expansion
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- api: Expanded SUPPORTED_TOOLKITS from 4 to 12 connectors (added Gmail, Google Calendar, Spotify, Instagram, Twitter/X, YouTube, Slack, LinkedIn)
- api: Expanded ALLOWED_ARTIST_CONNECTORS to include spotify, instagram, twitter, youtube (in addition to tiktok)
- api: Updated CONNECTOR_DISPLAY_NAMES with 8 new entries
- api: Updated 3 test files — all 13 tests pass
**PRs:** https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/337
**Notes:** PR targets `test` branch. Changes are in feature/composio-more-connectors branch.

## [2026-03-24] Coding agent tag-based filtering
**Prompt:** Add tag filter chips to admin coding page with new API endpoint for filter options
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: Added optional `tag` query param to `GET /api/admins/coding/slack` (filters by user_id); created new `GET /api/admins/coding-agent/slack-tags` endpoint returning distinct Slack users; added 5 passing tests
- `admin`: Added `SlackTagOption`/`SlackTagOptionsResponse` types; created `fetchSlackTagOptions` and `useSlackTagOptions`; updated `useSlackTags` to accept optional `tag` param; updated `CodingAgentSlackTagsPage` with clickable filter chips, toggle, and clear-filter UX
**PRs:**
- api: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/338 (base: test)
- admin: https://github.com/recoupable/admin/pull/23 (base: main)
**Notes:** Admin lint was non-functional due to pre-existing monorepo root eslint.config.js missing `@eslint/js` package — unrelated to this task. API lint errors in my new files match the same pattern as existing route files (pre-existing jsdoc rules). All new tests pass.

## [2026-03-24] Hire Sr Dev agent (REC-8)
**Prompt:** Create a new Sr Dev agent that handles coding tasks delegated by the CTO, working closely with the Code Reviewer agent
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `mono/agents/sr-dev/AGENTS.md`: Created instructions file for the Sr Dev agent covering code standards, git workflow, build commands, and Code Reviewer integration
**PRs:** none
**Notes:** Hire approved by board. Sr Dev agent (81d2b822-486a-4d29-8d43-87d83d740239) is active and idle. Workflow: CTO delegates coding tasks → Sr Dev implements → Code Reviewer reviews → feedback tasks routed back to Sr Dev.

## [2026-03-26] Song Filtering for Content Creation Pipeline
**Prompt:** Add optional songs filter to content creation pipeline so callers can limit generation to specific songs/EPs
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: Added `songs?: string[]` to `contentCreationSchema`; `selectAudioClip` now filters by slug before random selection; `createContentTask` passes `payload.songs` through; 6 new tests passing
- `api`: Added `songs?: string[]` to `TriggerCreateContentPayload` interface in `lib/trigger/triggerCreateContent.ts`
**PRs:**
- tasks: pending (branch: feature/song-filtering-for-content-pipeline)
- api: pending (branch: agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr---song-filtering--1774495678034)
**Notes:** Caller is responsible for translating user intent (e.g. "ADHD EP") into song slug arrays. Pipeline just filters — no release detection logic.
