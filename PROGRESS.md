## Current State of Each Submodule

### `tasks` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `fad189e` fix: push mono repo root progress files directly to main (#96)
- `e2599e7` fix: set cwd to `/vercel/sandbox/mono` for Claude Code agent (#94)
- `70f345c` feat: increase maxDuration of coding-agent task (#89)
- `6625395` feat: inject `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` into sandbox environment (#86)

**Status:** Stable. The coding agent pipeline is working end-to-end:
1. Sandbox spins up → monorepo cloned → submodules synced
2. Claude Code agent runs with the user prompt (cwd = `/vercel/sandbox/mono`)
3. Changes are committed and PRs opened via `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent`
4. Mono repo root files (e.g., `PROGRESS.md`) are pushed directly to `main`

**What to know:** `runClaudeCodeAgent` now defaults `cwd` to `/vercel/sandbox/mono`. The `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent` agent handles both mono root changes (direct push to main) and submodule changes (feature branch + PR).

---

### `api` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `6ff735d` feat: add Slack chat bot integration for Record Label Agent (#296)
- `f1d9035` feat: add content-creation API endpoints and video persistence (#259)
- `5b1f6bc` feat: admin accounts table endpoint (#288)
- `6c5eda3` feat: endpoint to check if authenticated account is admin (#281)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch, not `main`.

**What to know:** Slack integration added for Record Label Agent. Content-creation endpoints live. Admin-check endpoint added.

---

### `chat` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `03714296` feat: add navbar item for accounts (#1574)
- `729a9062` feat: task page top-left back link (#1573)
- `6efe316d` fix: duration stuck at 0ms for in-progress tasks (#1572)
- `eaeb5799` feat: polling UI for `prompt_sandbox` when `runId` present (#1563)
- `c3611b31` feat: move pulse to tasks page as Schedule/Recent/Pulse tabs (#1561)
- `c7fb2744` feat: artist connectors UI with tabbed settings modal (#1558)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch.

**What to know:** Tasks page has been significantly built out — duration display, polling UI for sandbox runs, and pulse moved to tabs. Navbar now has accounts link.

---

### `cli` (on `feature/accounts-and-keys-commands`)
**Latest commits:**
- `8b090df` feat: add accounts and keys commands to CLI
- `a09929a` chore: bump version to 0.1.11
- `e4d4548` feat: add `recoup content` command suite (#13)

**Status:** PR open targeting `main`. 92 tests passing.

**What to know:** Added `recoup accounts create/upgrade` and `recoup keys list/create/delete`. Added `del()` to client.ts. Keys commands require the API PR (`feature/keys-api-key-auth`) to be merged first so x-api-key auth works on `/api/keys` endpoints.

---

### `docs` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `fd82b14` feat: add authentication page (#62)
- `0445501` docs: add CLI content command documentation (#61)
- `bf59ecf` docs: update `/api/admins/sandboxes` docs (#59)
- `e49f7ca` docs: add admin accounts table endpoint docs (#58)

**Status:** Stable. Docs are at `https://developers.recoupable.com`.

---

### `admin` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `3fcd006` feat: update favicon to match app (#6)
- `11b64e2` feat: accounts table with subscription status (#5)
- `5dd9571` feat: endpoint to check if account is admin (#3)
- `47295e8` feat: Privy login support (#2)
- `b53363f` feat: initial Next.js app setup (#1)

**Status:** Stable. Basic admin dashboard with Privy auth, accounts table, admin check, and new Org Repos commits table.

**What to know:** Added `/sandboxes/orgs` page showing a data table of commits per org sub-module. Key column is "Recent Commits" (latest_commit_messages array) showing up to 5 latest commit messages per repo. Data from `GET /api/admins/sandboxes/orgs`. New files: `types/sandbox.ts` (OrgRepoRow), `lib/fetchAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `hooks/useAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `components/SandboxOrgs/*`, `app/sandboxes/orgs/page.tsx`, `components/Home/OrgReposNavButton.tsx`. Nav button added to AdminDashboard.

## [2026-03-16] Account Task Runs Page + Pulse Sub-Task Tagging

**Prompt:** Admin page to view recent Pulse task runs for a specific account (e.g., "What Pulse emails has Alexis received in the past 7 days?")
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: Created `sendPulseTask` sub-task (`src/tasks/sendPulseTask.ts`). `sendPulsesTask` now calls `sendPulseTask.triggerAndWait(..., { tags: ['account:<id>'] })` per account so each run is queryable by account.
- `api`: Updated `validateGetTaskRunQuery.ts` to accept optional `account_id` query param. Admins (Bearer) can query any account; org API keys can query org members. New supabase fn `selectAllAccountSnapshotsWithOwners` returns `{account_id, github_repo}[]`. `buildSubmoduleRepoMap` now returns `AccountRepoEntry[]` with account_id. `getOrgRepoStats` + `getAdminSandboxOrgsHandler` enriched to include email in `account_repos`.
- `docs`: `openapi.json` — added `account_id` param to `GET /api/tasks/runs`, updated `OrgRepoRow.account_repos` schema to `{account_id, email, repo_url}[]`.
- `admin`: New `/accounts/[account_id]` page with `AccountDetailPage` + `TaskRunsTable` showing Pulse runs. `AccountReposList` updated — each entry shows clickable email → `/accounts/[id]`. `sandboxesColumns` — account email is now a clickable link to `/accounts/[id]`.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually (gh not available in sandbox):
- tasks: `feature/pulse-sub-task-account-tag`
- api: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param` (target: `test`)
- docs: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param`
- admin: `feature/account-task-runs-page`
**Notes:** To answer "What Pulse emails has Alexis received?": find Alexis's `account_id` via `/sandboxes` page (or `/sandboxes/orgs`), then go to `/accounts/<id>` — the page shows all `send-pulse-task` runs for that account with status and timestamps.

## [2026-03-16] Pulse Run onClick — Email HTML Preview

**Prompt:** On /accounts/[account_id], clicking a send-pulse-task row should show the Resend email HTML sent during that task run.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New `lib/supabase/memory_emails/selectAccountEmailIds.ts` — joins rooms → memories → memory_emails to get Resend email IDs for an account. New `lib/admins/emails/getAdminEmailsHandler.ts` + `app/api/admins/emails/route.ts` — `GET /api/admins/emails?account_id=<id>` fetches each email from Resend SDK (returns id, subject, to, from, html, created_at). Admin Bearer auth required.
- `admin`: `TaskRunsTable` — added optional `onRunClick` prop; rows show `cursor-pointer` when clickable. `AccountDetailPage` — tracks `selectedRun` state, passes `onRunClick` to pulse runs table. New `PulseEmailModal` — fetches all emails for the account via `usePulseEmails`, matches the email closest to the run's time window (±5 min buffer), renders HTML in a sandboxed iframe. New `usePulseEmails` hook (lazy, enabled only when modal opens). New `fetchAccountPulseEmails` lib function.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually:
- api: `feature/admin-pulse-email-preview` (target: `test`)
- admin: `feature/pulse-email-preview` (target: `main`)
**Notes:** Email matching uses the run's `startedAt`/`finishedAt` window ±5 min. Falls back to the most recent email for the account if no match. The `memory_emails` table is the link — emails only appear here if `handleSendEmailToolOutputs` was called after the pulse (i.e., the sandbox chat flow ran through the standard chat handler). If pulse emails aren't showing, check that `memory_emails` rows are being inserted for pulse runs.

## [2026-03-17] Admin README — API Calls Documentation

**Prompt:** Update the Admin README to highlight the API calls used and link to the docs where devs can learn more.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `admin`: Rewrote `README.md` — added "API Calls" section with a table of all 5 endpoints (`/api/admins`, `/api/admins/emails`, `/api/admins/sandboxes`, `/api/admins/sandboxes/orgs`, `/api/tasks/runs`), doc links to `developers.recoupable.com`, and a "Where each call is made" breakdown per hook/lib file. Also updated Tech Stack section to include Privy and TanStack React Query.
**PRs:** none (README-only change)
**Notes:** Doc links point to `https://developers.recoupable.com/api-reference/admins/*` and `.../tasks/runs`. All admin endpoints require Bearer auth (Privy access token).

---

## [2026-03-17] Admin Privy Logins Page

**Prompt:** Admin dashboard page to review Privy logins on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis — total count + table of results per time frame.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Added `GET /api/admins/privy` to `openapi.json` (path + `PrivyLoginRow` / `AdminPrivyLoginsResponse` schemas), new `api-reference/admins/privy.mdx`, updated `docs.json` nav.
- `api`: New `lib/admins/privy/fetchPrivyLogins.ts` — paginates Privy Management API, stops early once users are older than the cutoff. New `validateGetPrivyLoginsQuery.ts` (period: daily/weekly/monthly, default daily). New `getPrivyLoginsHandler.ts`. New `app/api/admins/privy/route.ts`. 11 unit tests, all green.
- `admin`: New `types/privy.ts`, `lib/recoup/fetchPrivyLogins.ts`, `hooks/usePrivyLogins.ts`. New `/privy` page with period toggle (Daily/Weekly/Monthly), total count badge, and login table (email, Privy DID, timestamp). Added "View Privy Logins" nav button to `AdminDashboard`.
**PRs:** Branches pushed — PRs need to be opened via GitHub:
- docs: `feature/admin-privy-logins-docs` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/docs/pull/new/feature/admin-privy-logins-docs
- api: `feature/admin-privy-logins` → test: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/feature/admin-privy-logins
- admin: `feature/privy-logins-page` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/admin/pull/new/feature/privy-logins-page
**Notes:** `fetchPrivyLogins` paginates `GET https://api.privy.io/v1/users?order=desc` and stops early once `created_at < cutoff`. This keeps the daily call fast (only fetches recent pages). If Privy returns users without `linked_accounts` email, the row shows `null` for email.

## [2026-03-17] API — Remove Org API Key Logic (All Keys Are Personal)

**Prompt:** All API keys are personal. If a personal account has access to an org, it can use account_id filtering within that org. Remove the distinction between personal and org API keys for access control.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New `lib/organizations/canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg.ts` — checks if two accounts share any org membership (2 DB queries: get current account's orgs, then check if target is in any of them). New `lib/organizations/__tests__/canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg.test.ts` (4 tests). Updated `lib/auth/validateAccountIdOverride.ts` — when `orgId` is null (personal key) and target ≠ self, falls back to `canAccessAccountViaAnyOrg()` instead of immediately returning 403. Updated `lib/auth/__tests__/validateAuthContext.test.ts` — updated "denies personal key" test to mock the new function, added "allows personal key with shared org" test. All 1526 tests pass.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/remove-org-api-key-logic` pushed to `recoupable/api` (target: `test`):
- https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/agent/remove-org-api-key-logic
**Notes:** Only `validateAccountIdOverride.ts` was changed in auth. The `buildGet*Params` functions that receive `orgId` from auth context don't need changes — when a personal key accesses via shared org, `orgId` in the auth context stays `null`, and the query params builders already handle `orgId: null` by not filtering on org. The access gate is purely in `validateAccountIdOverride`.

## Known Issues / Next Steps

- `SUBMODULE_CONFIG` in `tasks/src/sandboxes/submoduleConfig.ts` does **not** include `admin` or `marketing` — if the agent modifies those submodules, PRs won't be auto-created. Consider adding them.
- No `PROGRESS_USAGE.md` exists yet — if this file should have a companion usage guide, create it.
- The `progress.txt` init file referenced in the task prompt was not found — likely hasn't been created yet, or was intended as a seed for future use.

## Architecture Reminder

```
chat (frontend) → api (backend) → Supabase (database)
                              ↘ tasks (async Trigger.dev jobs)
```

- **Coding agent flow:** Trigger.dev task → Vercel Sandbox → Claude Code CLI (`claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`) → git commit/push → PR via `gh`
- PRs for `api` and `chat` target `test` branch; all others target `main`
- Admin check: POST `/api/admins/check` — verifies if authenticated Privy user is in admins table

## [2026-03-17] Docs — Added response items for GET /api/admins/privy

**Prompt:** Update docs for GET /api/admins/privy to include the latest API response — missing default of `all` for period and missing response fields (`total_new`, `total_active`, `total_privy_users`)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Updated `api-reference/openapi.json` — added `all` to `period` enum (set as default, replacing incorrect `daily` default); added missing 200 response fields: `total_new`, `total_active`, `total_privy_users`; updated endpoint description to reflect actual API behavior.
**PRs:** Branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-docs---added-resp-1773769254740` pushed to `recoupable/docs` — PR targeting `main`.
**Notes:** Actual API code (`validateGetPrivyLoginsQuery.ts`) defaults `period` to `"all"` (no date filter). Handler returns `{ status, total, total_new, total_active, total_privy_accounts, logins }`.

---

## [2026-03-17] Docs — Rename total_privy_users to total_privy_accounts

**Prompt:** Change `total_privy_users` to `total_privy_accounts` in the GET /api/admins/privy OpenAPI spec.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `docs`: Renamed `total_privy_users` → `total_privy_accounts` in `api-reference/openapi.json` (required field list, property name, and description).
**PRs:** Pushed to existing branch `agent/-u0ajm7x8fbr-docs---added-resp-1773769254740` on `recoupable/docs`.
**Notes:** Matches the API response field naming convention (accounts, not users).

---

## [2026-03-21] CLI — accounts and keys commands

**Prompt:** Add the ability for users to create an account, upgrade to pro, and create and delete their API keys via the CLI.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `cli`: New `src/commands/accounts.ts` — `recoup accounts create --email/--wallet` (POST /api/accounts, no auth required) and `recoup accounts upgrade` (prints https://chat.recoupable.com/settings). New `src/commands/keys.ts` — `recoup keys list` (GET /api/keys), `recoup keys create --name` (POST /api/keys), `recoup keys delete --id` (DELETE /api/keys). Added `del()` to `src/client.ts`. Commands registered in `src/bin.ts`. 18 new tests; 92 total passing.
- `api`: Updated `lib/keys/getApiKeysHandler.ts`, `createApiKeyHandler.ts`, `deleteApiKeyHandler.ts` to use `validateAuthContext` instead of `getAuthenticatedAccountId` so CLI users with `RECOUP_API_KEY` (x-api-key header) can manage keys.
**PRs:** Branches pushed — PRs need to be opened via GitHub (gh not available in sandbox):
- cli: `feature/accounts-and-keys-commands` → main: https://github.com/recoupable/cli/pull/new/feature/accounts-and-keys-commands
- api: `feature/keys-api-key-auth` → test: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/feature/keys-api-key-auth
**Notes:** Merge the `api` PR first (so x-api-key works on /api/keys), then the `cli` PR. `accounts upgrade` has no backend — it just prints the upgrade URL since no Stripe/subscription endpoint exists. `POST /api/accounts` returns `{ data: { account_id, email, ... } }` (nested shape — legacy behavior from existing handler).

## [2026-03-21] Artist Intelligence Pack — Spotify + MusicFlamingo AI + Perplexity → Marketing Copy

**Prompt:** Implement the wildest, most WOW demoable feature using underutilized API keys and services.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New domain `lib/artistIntel/` (7 files + 1 test file):
  - `generateArtistIntelPack.ts` — main orchestrator; fetches Spotify → runs MusicFlamingo + Perplexity in parallel → AI synthesis
  - `getArtistSpotifyData.ts` — artist profile + top tracks with 30-second Spotify preview URLs (public MP3s, no auth needed)
  - `getArtistMusicAnalysis.ts` — runs 4 MusicFlamingo NVIDIA 8B presets in parallel on the Spotify preview: `catalog_metadata` (BPM/key/genre/mood/instruments), `audience_profile` (demographics), `playlist_pitch` (target playlists), `mood_tags` (vibe tags)
  - `getArtistWebContext.ts` — Perplexity search for recent press, streaming news, trends
  - `buildArtistMarketingCopy.ts` — AI synthesizes all data into: playlist pitch email, Instagram/TikTok/Twitter captions, press release opener, key talking points
  - `validateArtistIntelBody.ts` — Zod validation (artist_name required)
  - `generateArtistIntelPackHandler.ts` — route handler with `validateAuthContext`
- `api`: New endpoint `POST /api/artists/intel` — takes `{ artist_name }`, returns complete intelligence pack
- `api`: New MCP tool `generate_artist_intel_pack` in `lib/mcp/tools/artistIntel/` — registered in `lib/mcp/tools/index.ts`, available in the AI agent chat UI
- 10 unit tests, all green. All 218 test files passing (1514 tests). No lint errors on new files.
**PRs:**
- api: `feature/artist-intel-pack` → test: https://github.com/recoupable/api/pull/new/feature/artist-intel-pack
**Notes:**
- **Why this is WOW:** Type an artist name → in ~30 seconds get a complete professional marketing package powered by NVIDIA AI audio analysis. Artists can use this immediately for playlist pitching, PR outreach, and social campaigns.
- **Key insight:** Spotify `preview_url` on tracks is a public 30-second MP3 clip — MusicFlamingo accepts any audio URL, so we can analyze ANY artist's music without auth or file uploads.
- **MusicFlamingo endpoint:** `https://sidney-78147--music-flamingo-musicflamingo-generate.modal.run` (Modal serverless, already live).
- **Demo flow:** In the chat UI, ask the agent: "Generate an artist intelligence pack for [artist name]" — `generate_artist_intel_pack` MCP tool fires automatically and returns the full pack.
- **Parallel processing:** Spotify first (required for preview URL), then MusicFlamingo + Perplexity fire simultaneously, then AI synthesis. Graceful degradation if any source fails.
