## Current State of Each Submodule

### `tasks` (on `main`)
**Latest commits:**
- `fad189e` fix: push mono repo root progress files directly to main (#96)
- `e2599e7` fix: set cwd to `/vercel/sandbox/mono` for Claude Code agent (#94)
- `70f345c` feat: increase maxDuration of coding-agent task (#89)
- `6625395` feat: inject `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` into sandbox environment (#86)

**Status:** Stable. The coding agent pipeline is working end-to-end:
1. Sandbox spins up → monorepo cloned → submodules synced
2. Claude Code agent runs with the user prompt (cwd = `/vercel/sandbox/mono`)
3. Changes are committed and PRs opened via `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent`
4. Mono repo root files (e.g., `PROGRESS.md`) are pushed directly to `main`

**What to know:** `runClaudeCodeAgent` now defaults `cwd` to `/vercel/sandbox/mono`. The `pushAndCreatePRsViaAgent` agent handles both mono root changes (direct push to main) and submodule changes (feature branch + PR).

### `api` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `6ff735d` feat: add Slack chat bot integration for Record Label Agent (#296)
- `f1d9035` feat: add content-creation API endpoints and video persistence (#259)
- `5b1f6bc` feat: admin accounts table endpoint (#288)
- `6c5eda3` feat: endpoint to check if authenticated account is admin (#281)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch, not `main`.

**What to know:** Slack integration added for Record Label Agent. Content-creation endpoints live. Admin-check endpoint added.

---

### `chat` (on `test`)
**Latest commits:**
- `03714296` feat: add navbar item for accounts (#1574)
- `729a9062` feat: task page top-left back link (#1573)
- `6efe316d` fix: duration stuck at 0ms for in-progress tasks (#1572)
- `eaeb5799` feat: polling UI for `prompt_sandbox` when `runId` present (#1563)
- `c3611b31` feat: move pulse to tasks page as Schedule/Recent/Pulse tabs (#1561)
- `c7fb2744` feat: artist connectors UI with tabbed settings modal (#1558)

**Status:** Stable on `test`. PRs target `test` branch.

**What to know:** Tasks page has been significantly built out — duration display, polling UI for sandbox runs, and pulse moved to tabs. Navbar now has accounts link.

---

- `47295e8` feat: Privy login support (#2)
- `b53363f` feat: initial Next.js app setup (#1)

**Status:** Stable. Basic admin dashboard with Privy auth, accounts table, admin check, and new Org Repos commits table.

**What to know:** Added `/sandboxes/orgs` page showing a data table of commits per org sub-module. Key column is "Recent Commits" (latest_commit_messages array) showing up to 5 latest commit messages per repo. Data from `GET /api/admins/sandboxes/orgs`. New files: `types/sandbox.ts` (OrgRepoRow), `lib/fetchAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `hooks/useAdminSandboxOrgs.ts`, `components/SandboxOrgs/*`, `app/sandboxes/orgs/page.tsx`, `components/Home/OrgReposNavButton.tsx`. Nav button added to AdminDashboard.

## [2026-03-16] Account Task Runs Page + Pulse Sub-Task Tagging

**Prompt:** Admin page to view recent Pulse task runs for a specific account (e.g., "What Pulse emails has Alexis received in the past 7 days?")
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: Created `sendPulseTask` sub-task (`src/tasks/sendPulseTask.ts`). `sendPulsesTask` now calls `sendPulseTask.triggerAndWait(..., { tags: ['account:<id>'] })` per account so each run is queryable by account.
- `api`: Updated `validateGetTaskRunQuery.ts` to accept optional `account_id` query param. Admins (Bearer) can query any account; org API keys can query org members. New supabase fn `selectAllAccountSnapshotsWithOwners` returns `{account_id, github_repo}[]`. `buildSubmoduleRepoMap` now returns `AccountRepoEntry[]` with account_id. `getOrgRepoStats` + `getAdminSandboxOrgsHandler` enriched to include email in `account_repos`.
- `docs`: `openapi.json` — added `account_id` param to `GET /api/tasks/runs`, updated `OrgRepoRow.account_repos` schema to `{account_id, email, repo_url}[]`.
- `admin`: New `/accounts/[account_id]` page with `AccountDetailPage` + `TaskRunsTable` showing Pulse runs. `AccountReposList` updated — each entry shows clickable email → `/accounts/[id]`. `sandboxesColumns` — account email is now a clickable link to `/accounts/[id]`.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually (gh not available in sandbox):
- tasks: `feature/pulse-sub-task-account-tag`
- api: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param` (target: `test`)
- docs: `feature/task-runs-account-id-param`
- admin: `feature/account-task-runs-page`
**Notes:** To answer "What Pulse emails has Alexis received?": find Alexis's `account_id` via `/sandboxes` page (or `/sandboxes/orgs`), then go to `/accounts/<id>` — the page shows all `send-pulse-task` runs for that account with status and timestamps.

## [2026-03-16] Pulse Run onClick — Email HTML Preview

**Prompt:** On /accounts/[account_id], clicking a send-pulse-task row should show the Resend email HTML sent during that task run.
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `api`: New `lib/supabase/memory_emails/selectAccountEmailIds.ts` — joins rooms → memories → memory_emails to get Resend email IDs for an account. New `lib/admins/emails/getAdminEmailsHandler.ts` + `app/api/admins/emails/route.ts` — `GET /api/admins/emails?account_id=<id>` fetches each email from Resend SDK (returns id, subject, to, from, html, created_at). Admin Bearer auth required.
- `admin`: `TaskRunsTable` — added optional `onRunClick` prop; rows show `cursor-pointer` when clickable. `AccountDetailPage` — tracks `selectedRun` state, passes `onRunClick` to pulse runs table. New `PulseEmailModal` — fetches all emails for the account via `usePulseEmails`, matches the email closest to the run's time window (±5 min buffer), renders HTML in a sandboxed iframe. New `usePulseEmails` hook (lazy, enabled only when modal opens). New `fetchAccountPulseEmails` lib function.
**PRs:** Branches pushed, PRs need to be created manually:
- api: `feature/admin-pulse-email-preview` (target: `test`)
- admin: `feature/pulse-email-preview` (target: `main`)
**Notes:** Email matching uses the run's `startedAt`/`finishedAt` window ±5 min. Falls back to the most recent email for the account if no match. The `memory_emails` table is the link — emails only appear here if `handleSendEmailToolOutputs` was called after the pulse (i.e., the sandbox chat flow ran through the standard chat handler). If pulse emails aren't showing, check that `memory_emails` rows are being inserted for pulse runs.

## [2026-03-17] Admin PR Buttons in Slack Thread

**Prompt:** When coding-agent opens a PR in admin repo, show Review/Merge buttons in Slack (not just text)
**Status:** completed
**Changes:**
- `tasks`: Added `admin` and `marketing` to `SUBMODULE_CONFIG` so push agent handles these repos. Added `parseGitHubPRUrls` function to `parsePRUrls.ts` that extracts raw GitHub PR URLs from main agent stdout (for cases where main agent already ran `gh pr create` before push agent runs). Updated `codingAgentTask.ts` to merge PR results from both main agent stdout and push agent, deduplicating by URL.
**PRs:** `feature/admin-pr-buttons` pushed to `recoupable/tasks` — open PR at https://github.com/recoupable/tasks/pull/new/feature/admin-pr-buttons (target: `main`)
**Notes:** Root cause: main agent follows CLAUDE.md and creates PRs directly (outputting raw GitHub URL), but `parsePRUrls` only matched `PR_CREATED:` sentinel lines from the push agent. Admin/marketing were also missing from SUBMODULE_CONFIG so push agent skipped them entirely.

---

## Known Issues / Next Steps

- `SUBMODULE_CONFIG` now includes `admin` and `marketing` (fixed in `feature/admin-pr-buttons` PR).
- No `PROGRESS_USAGE.md` exists yet — if this file should have a companion usage guide, create it.
- The `progress.txt` init file referenced in the task prompt was not found — likely hasn't been created yet, or was intended as a seed for future use.

---

## Architecture Reminder

```
chat (frontend) → api (backend) → Supabase (database)
                              ↘ tasks (async Trigger.dev jobs)
```

- **Coding agent flow:** Trigger.dev task → Vercel Sandbox → Claude Code CLI (`claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions`) → git commit/push → PR via `gh`
- PRs for `api` and `chat` target `test` branch; all others target `main`
- Admin check: POST `/api/admins/check` — verifies if authenticated Privy user is in admins table
